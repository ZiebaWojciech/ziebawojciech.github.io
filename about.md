Community Leaders are people who actively and regularly collaborate on everyday JUG tasks such as organizing events, contacting sponsors, working along with other organizations etc. While we are open for every member of our community to participate, we have the resources and know-how gathered throughout years of activity. If you want to be a part of Warsaw Java User Group Leaders, to share an idea for WJUG or have any questions, please [contact us](/contact)
